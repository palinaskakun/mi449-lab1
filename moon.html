    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, has captivated human imagination for centuries.With a barren and desolate landscape, the Moon lacks the diverse ecosystems found on Earth. Its surface is marked by craters, mountains, and plains, shaped by meteoroid impacts and volcanic activity in the distant past. The Moon's lack of a substantial atmosphere means it has no weather or protective shield against cosmic rays and solar winds.</p>
