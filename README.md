# Moon & Earth Blog
Check out my Moon & Earth Blog on Netlify [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/earnest-belekoy-e04408/overview).

Used basic HTML and CSS, practiced setting up Eleventy. The pictures are clickable and lead to a different page (corresponds to the picture).

The pictures were created using Figma.
